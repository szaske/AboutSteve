How to add animation to an Android app RecyclerView

1. Create a ItemTouchHelper interface in util package
2. Create a OnStartDragListener interface helper
3. Create a ItemTouchHelperCallback class.  This catches the ItemTouchHelper callbacks and passes them to our adapter.
4. Download reorder icons to add to our viewholders and place them in the various mipmap folders
5. Edit the layout to include these new icons/images
6. Create a new adapter (FirebaseAwwListAdapter) that extends the built in FirebaseRecyclerAdapter
7. Edit the existing Activity (SavedAwwsListActivity) to make these changes
    a. Add implements OnStartDragListener to the class
    b. Add it's onStartDrag method
    b. Switch the adapter to FirebaseAwwListAdapter from ???
    c. Add a member variable private ItemTouchHelper mItemTouchHelper;
    d. Instantiate the helper in the Activities setUpFirebaseAdapter method

Swiping will now be implemented

8. Make a new public variable in the Viewholder class (mAwwImageView)
9. Change the variable binding to point to this new public variable
10. Create a setOnTouchListener method in the FirebaseAwwListAdapter's populateViewHolder method

Now dragging is implemented but not yet saved in Firebase

11. Edit the onItemMove method in the FirebaseAwwListAdapter
12. Edit the onItemDismiss method in the FirebaseAwwListAdapter
13. Edit the Model and add an index member variable.  Set it to not_specified in the constructor
14. Create getters and setters for this index variable.
15. Create a new Constant to point to this static FB location
16. Edit Activity
    a. Move Firebase instance creation to setUpFirebaseAdapter
    b. Change the FB database reference to a query
    c. Add orderByChild to end of query to order the results by index

Now we need to be able to get access to the Aww objects, and the index property...so we need to edit our
Adapter.

17. Add a ChildEventListener to the Adapter
18. Create a new private Array to hold the Awws objects list.
19. Instantiate the listener in the Adapter constructor, so we'll be listening when the adapter gets created.
20. Override all the listener methods
21. Edit the Adapter.onItemMove method to swap objects in the local adapter arraylist
22. Edit the Adapter.onItemDismiss method to delete the swiped object from the local
23. Create a new setIndexInFirebase() method in the adapter.  This method sets and saves the index numbers in Firebase
24. Override the FirebaseAdapter cleanup method to run this new index setting process.  Make sure you also remove the ChildEventListener.
25. Move the Onclick-listener from the Viewholder, to the Adapter.
